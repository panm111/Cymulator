# Cymulator

Cymulator is a leisure bike ride simulator. Users ride a stationary bike while watching a first-person video of a bike ride around Central Park or the streets of New York City.

Using a magnetic sensor on the back wheel of the bicycle, hooked up to the Arduino and running through Processing, the pedaling speed determines the speed of the video playback.
